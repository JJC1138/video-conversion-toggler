# Video Conversion Toggler for Denon and Marantz AV Receivers

Video Conversion Toggler is an app for Apple TV and other Apple platforms for toggling the video conversion setting on Denon and Marantz AV receivers. It wasn't made by Denon or Marantz and has no connection with those companies.

It exists because I found myself wanting to toggle this setting often when using Apple TV because some types of content are best with it switched off (games, apps with animation, and some video content at 50 or 59.97 Hz), and somes types are best with it switched on (films and most TV at 23.976 Hz). I made this app so that I could toggle it quickly from the Apple TV without having to use another remote and navigate through menus.

Unfortunately the setting that's needed isn't included in the official Denon/Marantz control protocol, so it's not available in remote control apps from the manufacturers or third parties. The setting is included in the devices' web interfaces, though, so this app just pretends to be a web browser and toggles it that way.
